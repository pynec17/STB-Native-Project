# STB-Native-Project

## Description
STB-Native-Project is a React Native application designed to fetch posts from the JSON placeholder website and display them in the app.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo on your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies using npm install
4. Run the commend `npx expo start` - setup may vary slightly depending on the device used, please refer to [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/) for further details

## Features
- Fetches and displays a list of posts.
- Expands/collapses post details on tap.

## Accessibility 
In an effort to improve accessibility, I have used some of React Native's Accessibility properties, including:
- Accessibility roles
- Accessibility labels
- Accessibility hints
to aid users using assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

All my testing was done using Android's Talkback feature (using a Google Pixel 9 Pro, specifically)
